# Breast Cancer Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust breast cancer detection system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Early detection of breast cancer plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes, and the integration of advanced technologies can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the diagnostic process.

## Features

- Utilizes AI and ML algorithms for breast cancer detection.
- Supports automated analysis of medical images, such as mammograms.
- Provides accurate predictions to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/the-lasya-projects/breast_cancer_detection.git
 ## 1. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd breast_cancer_detection
 ## 2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
 # Usage
## 1.Run the application:
python app.py
## 2.Access the application through your web browser:
http://localhost:5000
The web interface allows users to upload medical images for analysis.
## Data
The project uses a curated dataset of medical images for training and evaluation. The dataset includes a variety of mammograms and corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of breast cancer. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset used in this project is not included in the repository. However, you can obtain similar datasets from authorized medical sources.

## Model Training
The machine learning model is trained using state-of-the-art algorithms on the provided dataset. To train the model:

1. Prepare the dataset: Ensure that the medical image dataset is organized and labeled appropriately.

2. Run the training script:
   python train.py
3. The trained model will be saved for later use in the application.

  # Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation script:
python evaluate.py
This script assesses the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of the trained model on a validation dataset.
# Results
Document any significant results or findings obtained from the breast cancer detection system. Include metrics, visualizations, and comparisons with existing methods if applicable.
